{"prompt":"What is ENS?","completion":" The Ethereum Name Service or ENS is the decentralized naming protocol that is built on the Ethereum blockchain. It adheres to open-source standards and is based on a set of decentralized smart contracts that translate blockchain addresses into human-readable names. You can share your ENS name instead of a long, hard to remember crypto address. ENS is not solely a naming service for Ethereum, but in fact the wider blockchain ecosystem. ENS enables cross chain naming of long addresses such as crypto wallets, content hashes, metadata and even smart contracts.\n\nENS solves all three points of Zooko’s Triangle problem, which is to be a network protocol that is human meaningful, secure, decentralized. ENS names are programmable, and stored on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 NFT tokens and in the future as ERC-1155 NFT standard tokens. It works similarly to DNS, in that ENS names resolve long random number and letter combinations into human-readable labels. Because this is done on the Ethereum blockchain, it is secure, decentralized, and transparent. It is built on the foundation of Open Source programming, which means anyone can examine the code. The software code is published in the open, on the public blockchain ledger."}
{"prompt":"How was ENS started?","completion":" Early on the need was known to create a naming system for the blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain launched in 2015 and by April 2016 the concept of ENS was presented within the Ethereum Foundation by former Google engineer Nick Johnson.\n\nIn May of 2017, the first ENS names were minted, starting with rilxxlir.eth. The TLD or Top-Level Domain is .eth, a reserved “special use domain” within the ICANN or (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) namespace organization. Since the .eth TLD is already reserved for the country of Ethiopia, though not in use, it will prevent future naming collisions with DNS and help ensure integration with pre-existing DNS systems.\n\nIn 2018, ENS branched off from the Ethereum Foundation into its own project with the help of a grant from the EF to continue development and building of the protocol. It adheres to the concept of the Infinite Garden. ENS is part of that Infinite Garden ethos, reflecting the “nurture and grow, but do not control”. The core team at ENS Labs was funded through grants, and had no VC investors."}
{"prompt":"What can I use an ENS name for?","completion":" The first and most common use case for an ENS name is to use it as an easy-to-remember name for your cryptocurrency addresses. ENS supports many different cryptocurrencies, allowing you to receive payments in more cryptocurrencies than just Ethereum.\n\nThis alleviates the confusion associated with remembering your hexadecimal wallet address and provides easy payment options.\n\nENS names go far beyond that, however, allowing you to add all kinds of records to it from social media links, to profile pictures, custom records, and decentralized websites. This gives you a name that can serve as your complete Web3 identity."}
{"prompt":"Where are ENS names stored?","completion":" The ENS Registry, .eth Registrar, and Resolvers are all smart contracts on the Ethereum network."}
{"prompt":"How much does it cost to register an ENS name?","completion":" The cost of an ENS name is dependent on how many characters it contains. 5+ character names cost $5\/year, 4 character names cost $160\/year, and 3 character names cost $640\/year. All prices are denominated in ETH."}
{"prompt":"Why are fees collected?","completion":" The primary purpose of registration fees is as an incentive mechanism to prevent the namespace from becoming overwhelmed with speculatively registered names.\n\nA secondary purpose is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund the ongoing development of ENS."}
{"prompt":"How does name resolution work?","completion":" The Primary name is your reverse record responsible for resolving your wallet address to your ENS name, effectively helping DApps and other services display your ENS name based on your Ethereum wallet address.\n\nThe easiest way to understand it is to consider that name resolution works in two directions: Forward resolution is simply where your name points to and is determined by the ETH Address record set on your ENS name. Reverse resolution is where your wallet points to and is determined by the Primary name record set in your wallet."}
